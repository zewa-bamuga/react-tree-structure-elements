# React App for MCC Software test task

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## About the App

An application with a tree structure of elements on React has been implemented.

It is possible to add/delete/edit item names. It is also possible to reset the state to the initial one.

There is no use of third-party components when rendering the tree.

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.
